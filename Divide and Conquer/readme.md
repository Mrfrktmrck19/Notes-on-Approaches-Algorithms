# Divide & Conquer Approaching
This approach consist of three parts: <br/>
 ->Divide Section: In order to solve problem more easily, the problem is divided sub-problems.  <br/>
 ->Conquer Section: Solve sub-problems by calling recursively until solved.     <br/>
 ->Combine Section: Combine the sub-problems to get the final solution of the whole problem.  <br/>
 Most popular algorithms using DAC approach: Quicksort, Merge Sort, Closest Pair of Points, Strassen’s Algorithm, Cooley–Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Algorithm, Karatsuba Algorithm. <br/>
